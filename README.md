# Coffee Shop Front-End HTML CSS Project with React JS

Coffee Shop HTML CSS is not just a project; it's a journey to elevate the Coffee Shop experience on the Front-End. This immersive project unfolds a tapestry of essential pages, including the Login, Register, Home, Product, Profile, Checkout, and History Order pages. Witness the magic as Tailwind CSS gracefully dances through each element, styling the project with finesse, while Javascript orchestrates the logic behind the scenes. Brace yourself for a visual feast, as the project seamlessly embraces responsive design, catering to screens ranging from the compact elegance of Mobile-S (320px) to the expansive grandeur of Laptop-L and beyond (>1440px). Immerse yourself in a world where every pixel tells a story and every click unfolds a new chapter in the Coffee Shop HTML CSS saga.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Features

- Vite React JS
  Vite is a build tool designed for web development, and when paired with React JS, it provides a fast and efficient development environment. It optimizes the build process, enabling quick development and seamless debugging for React applications.
- React Redux
  React Redux is a state management library for React applications. It helps manage the state of the application in a predictable way, making it easier to handle complex data and maintain a clear flow of information between components.
- React Router Dom
  React Router Dom is a library for handling navigation in React applications. It enables the creation of dynamic, single-page applications by allowing developers to define routes and navigate between different components or pages without triggering a full page reload.
- Tailwind
  Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that simplifies styling in web development. It provides a set of pre-defined utility classes that can be directly applied to HTML elements, streamlining the styling process and allowing for quick and consistent design implementation.
- Axios
  Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. It simplifies the process of making HTTP requests, handling responses, and performing asynchronous operations in web applications. Axios is commonly used to interact with APIs and fetch data from servers.
