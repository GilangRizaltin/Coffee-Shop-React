Coffee Shop HTML CSS is not just a project; it's a journey to elevate the Coffee Shop experience on the Front-End. This immersive project unfolds a tapestry of essential pages, including the Login, Register, Home, Product, Profile, Checkout, and History Order pages. Witness the magic as Tailwind CSS gracefully dances through each element, styling the project with finesse, while Javascript orchestrates the logic behind the scenes. Brace yourself for a visual feast, as the project seamlessly embraces responsive design, catering to screens ranging from the compact elegance of Mobile-S (320px) to the expansive grandeur of Laptop-L and beyond (>1440px). Immerse yourself in a world where every pixel tells a story and every click unfolds a new chapter in the Coffee Shop HTML CSS saga.
